TODO:

- Write SeaJSON library (DONE sorta, read JSON is done but write JSON not done)
- Make zones.c able to load zones from a JSON file using SeaJSON (DONE)
- Convert the test zone into test_zone.json (DONE)
- Make a level editor (DONE sorta, when SeaJSON has write support, make it write levels)
- This level editor will make it easier to create levels for Gravity for me, as well as be easy to use for other players and allow them to easily make custom levels
- Stop going up when jumping if player bumps head (DONE)
- Stop clipping to top of platforms when jumping from the side (DONE)
- Optimize
- Add pause ability (DONE)
- Make resource path finder (DONE)
- With colliding_platform, there is currently no way to differ between a return fail and when the platform that is colliding is the platform in index 0. This causes you to be unable to remove platform index 0 when right clicking.
