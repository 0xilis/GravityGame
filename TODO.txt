TODO:

- Write SeaJSON library (DONE sorta, read JSON is done but write JSON not done)
- Make a level editor (DONE sorta, when SeaJSON has write support, make it write levels)
- This level editor will make it easier to create levels for Gravity for me, as well as be easy to use for other players and allow them to easily make custom levels
- Optimize
- With colliding_platform, there is currently no way to differ between a return fail and when the platform that is colliding is the platform in index 0. This causes you to be unable to remove platform index 0 when right clicking. (DONE)
- Move collision to collision.c
- Improve pause menu, perhaps add window resizing options
- More platforms other than the current generic ones, ex moving platforms/conveyor belts/slime platforms
- Coins(?) (don't just put coins in the game; have the coins serve a purpose like a shop or something)
