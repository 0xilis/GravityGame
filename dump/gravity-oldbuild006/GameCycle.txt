GRAVITY GAME CYCLE
0xilis

This document is a description of the game cycle in current build 006.

Highest Level Understanding of Cycle after loading:
-handle_events (SDL_Quit, key presses, player movement)
-If not paused, update (screen scrolling, player gravity movement, up/down position fixes)
-render (render)

handle_events() cycle:
-Get event, handles SDL_QUIT, P/Pause, Z/GravityFlip, Left/Right Clicks
-If paused, return/end function
-Get keys
-If left, left movement
-If right, right movement
-If neither right or left, reset moveProgress
-If up, jump movement
-If not up, sets playerHitMaxHeight to 1
-Check up/down platform collision, if so, not currently jumping and resets jumpHeight/isJumping/didHitMaxHeight all to 0

update() cycle:
-Screen scrolls by looping through all platforms in current zone
-Checks platform up/down collision, if no collision apply gravity, if collision, reset gravity
-Checks again platform up/down collision, if so, fix y position

render() cycle:
-Clears Screen, fills it with black, then copies background texture
-Cycles through all platforms and draws then
-Draws player rect, copies texture to player
-Presents
