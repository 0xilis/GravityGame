# Reporting Security Issues

Gravity is a 2D platformer made to be enjoyed and not as an entrypoint for malware. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/0xilis/GravityGame/security/advisories/new) tab.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

While SeaJSON is technically a third party library, since I myself maintain it anyways, feel free to report SeaJSON issues here as well. Do keep in mind however that SeaJSON does also have a ["GitHub Security Advisory"](https://github.com/0xilis/SeaJSON/security/advisories/new).
